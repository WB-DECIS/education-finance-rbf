  <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">What is result-based financing in education? </h2>
  <ul style="list-style: none; padding: 0;">
  <li>
Results-based financing (RBF) is an umbrella term referring to any program or intervention that provides rewards to individuals or institutions after agreed-upon results are achieved and verified. The approach aims to incentivize teachers, students, families, schools, and governments to achieve better results and improve the effectiveness and efficiency of spending in education.  
  </li>
  <li>
Typical RBF interventions include conditional cash transfers for children and families, teacher incentives, and performance-based grants for schools or governments. Results can be measured as outputs (such as the implementation of a new teacher training system), intermediate outcomes (such as teacher attendance), final outcomes (such as students’ learning) or - more likely - a mixture. Incentives or rewards can be monetary or non-monetary.   
 </li>
 <li>
The RBF approach has the potential to encourage stakeholders to focus on actions necessary to improve the agreed-upon results, foster the identification of local solutions to alleviate bottlenecks, and strengthen the capacity of education systems to measure and track progress. However, the adoption of the RBF approach does not automatically guarantee success in improving results. Research evidence on its effectiveness has been mixed. Whether RBF works depends on both the design and the implementation of the intervention.  
</li>
  <li>

<h2 style="font-weight: bold;"> What is this dashboard for?</h2>
    <ul style="list-style: none; padding: 0;">
<li>This dashboard is designed for World Bank country teams and Task Team Leaders who are interested in adopting the RBF approach when designing and implementing education lending projects.  </li>

<li>The development team compiled 88 World Bank education lending projects that i) used the RBF approach and ii) were approved between 2015 and 2021 and summarized their characteristics in design.  </li>
<li>This dashboard provides filter functions to help users quickly locate existing lending projects based on their interests and criteria. It also allows users to get an overview of what specific elements of education focus areas have been addressed through the RBF approach in World Bank financed projects. </li>
